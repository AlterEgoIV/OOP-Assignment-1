# OOP-Assignment-1
This is a data visualisation program based on certain aspects of Arsenals Premier League stats. 
The two data visualisations are a barchart and a bubblechart.

The barchart shows Arsenals goals scored per game for every season. The height of the bars is set based on
the goals scored per game for each season.

The bubblechart shows Arsenals goals conceded per game for every season. The height of the bubbles is set based on
the goals conceded per game for each season.

For each graph, colour gradient is used to further highlight the differences in season values, with the 
lower values being represented with darker reds and higher values being represented with brighter reds. 

Axis descriptions are included for both.

To allow the user to choose which visualisation to view, a menu has been included. The menu features an Arsenal banner,
two highlightable buttons and image cycling, whereby several Arsenal related images are cycled through repeatedly 
at set intervals. Highlightable return buttons have also been included in the barchart and bubblechart visualisations.
